         # the following code is for fixing the vulnerability CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting)
         # by escaping the user input to prevent it from being executed as JavaScript code.
         # This is done by using the escape() method provided by the Django framework.
         # The escape() method replaces special characters with their corresponding HTML entities.
         # This ensures that the user input is properly encoded and prevents it from being executed as JavaScript code.
         # For example, if the user input is '<script>alert("XSS")</script>', it will be escaped to '&lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;XSS&quot;)&lt;/script&gt;'.
         # This way, the user input will be displayed as plain text on the webpage, and cannot be executed as JavaScript code.
         # This is a mitigation for the vulnerability CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).
         # The escape() method is called on the user input to prevent it from being executed as JavaScript code.
