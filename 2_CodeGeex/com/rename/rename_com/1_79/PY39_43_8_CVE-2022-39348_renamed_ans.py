    # the following code is for fixing the vulnerability CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting)
    # by ensuring that the file name is properly escaped before opening it.
    # This prevents an attacker from injecting malicious code into the file name.
    # The code below is a simple example of how to escape a file name.
    # In a real-world application, you would need to use a proper library or function for escaping.
    # For example, in Python, you could use the urllib.parse.quote function.
    escaped_fn = urllib.parse.quote(fn, safe='')  # This is a placeholder, replace with proper escaping.
